# Indigo


Indigo is a simple CLI tool I use to rapidly begin a new toy project. It has a target audience of one; myself. This reduces the need for maintenance, and makes it acceptable to neglect for months on end. 

## Install

```
brew install indigo
```
## Usage

```
$ indigo
Example Usage:
	indigo nickname project-name
	indigo nickname project-name -OPTIONS
	indigo add repo-name nickname
	indigo rm nickname
	indigo list | ls | -l	
	indigo help | -h
	
```
